# Servo Control Box

# Proprietary
Unfortunately, this code is proprietary; thus, only a very small snippet is included here.

## Overview
This project focuses on initiating automated testing practices by creating an embedded system control box using Arduino microcontrollers. The box controls 5V servos and automate tests that are typically performed manually.

## Key Features
- Automated testing protocols ensure that tests meet required standards and are completed more quickly.


## Getting Started
Includes a 20-page guide on how to operate the control box

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino microcontroller (along with a range of sensors and additional components)
